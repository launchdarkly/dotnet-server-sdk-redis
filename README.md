LaunchDarkly SDK for .NET - Redis integration
=============================================
[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/launchdarkly/dotnet-client-redis.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/launchdarkly/dotnet-client-redis)

This library provides a Redis-backed persistence mechanism (feature store) for the [LaunchDarkly .NET SDK](https://github.com/launchdarkly/dotnet-client), replacing the default in-memory feature store. The underlying Redis client implementation is [StackExchange.Redis](https://github.com/StackExchange/StackExchange.Redis).

The minimum version of the LaunchDarkly .NET SDK for use with this library is 5.6.0.

For more information, see also: [Using a persistent feature store](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/v2.0/docs/using-a-persistent-feature-store).

.NET platform compatibility
---------------------------

This version of the library is compatible with .NET Framework version 4.5 and above, .NET Standard 1.6, and .NET Standard 2.0.

Quick setup
-----------

1. Use [NuGet](http://docs.nuget.org/docs/start-here/using-the-package-manager-console) to add this package to your project:

        Install-Package LaunchDarkly.Client.Redis

   Or, if you require a strong-named assembly (note that this will result in a transitive dependency on StackExchange.Redis.StrongName, rather than StackExchange.Redis):

        Install-Package LaunchDarkly.Client.Redis.StrongName

2. Import the package:

        using LaunchDarkly.Client.Redis;

3. When configuring your `LDClient`, add the Redis feature store:

        Configuration ldConfig = Configuration.Default("YOUR_SDK_KEY")
            .WithFeatureStoreFactory(RedisComponents.RedisFeatureStore());
        LdClient ldClient = new LdClient(ldConfig);

4. Optionally, you can change the Redis configuration by calling methods on the builder returned by `RedisFeatureStore()`:

        Configuration ldConfig = Configuration.Default("YOUR_SDK_KEY")
            .WithFeatureStoreFactory(
                RedisComponents.RedisFeatureStore()
                    .WithRedisHostAndPort("my-redis-host", 6379)
                    .WithConnectTimeout(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(3))
            );
        LdClient ldClient = new LdClient(ldConfig);

5. If you are running a [LaunchDarkly Relay Proxy](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-relay) instance, you can use it in [daemon mode](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-relay#daemon-mode), so that the SDK retrieves flag data only from Redis and does not communicate directly with LaunchDarkly. This is controlled by the SDK's `UseLdd` option:

        Configuration ldConfig = Configuration.Default("YOUR_SDK_KEY")
            .WithFeatureStoreFactory(RedisComponents.RedisFeatureStore())
            .WithUseLdd(true);
        LdClient ldClient = new LdClient(ldConfig);

Caching behavior
----------------

To reduce traffic to the Redis server, there is an optional in-memory cache that retains the last known data for a configurable amount of time. This is on by default; to turn it off (and guarantee that the latest feature flag data will always be retrieved from Redis for every flag evaluation), configure the builder as follows:

                RedisComponents.RedisFeatureStore()
                    .WithCaching(FeatureStoreCacheConfig.Disabled)

Or, to cache for longer than the default of 30 seconds:

                RedisComponents.RedisFeatureStore()
                    .WithCaching(FeatureStoreCacheConfig.Enabled.WithTtlSeconds(60))

Signing
-------

The published versions of these assemblies are digitally signed by LaunchDarkly.

The `LaunchDarkly.Client.Redis.StrongName` assembly is also [strong-named](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/app-domains/strong-named-assemblies); `LaunchDarkly.Client.Redis` is not strong-named. The reason for this difference is that the StackExchange.Redis library is also built in two versions so if LaunchDarkly provided only a strong-named version, it would cause a dependency conflict if the application happened to be using the non-strong-named version of StackExchange.Redis for other purposes.

Building the code locally in the default Debug configuration does not sign the assembly and does not require a key file.

Development notes
-----------------

This project imports the `dotnet-base` and `dotnet-client-shared-tests` repositories as subtrees. See the `README.md` file in each of those directories for more information.

To run unit tests, you must have a local Redis server.

Releases are done using the release script in `dotnet-base`. Since the published package includes a .NET Framework 4.5 build, the release must be done from Windows.

About LaunchDarkly
-----------

* LaunchDarkly is a continuous delivery platform that provides feature flags as a service and allows developers to iterate quickly and safely. We allow you to easily flag your features and manage them from the LaunchDarkly dashboard.  With LaunchDarkly, you can:
    * Roll out a new feature to a subset of your users (like a group of users who opt-in to a beta tester group), gathering feedback and bug reports from real-world use cases.
    * Gradually roll out a feature to an increasing percentage of users, and track the effect that the feature has on key metrics (for instance, how likely is a user to complete a purchase if they have feature A versus feature B?).
    * Turn off a feature that you realize is causing performance problems in production, without needing to re-deploy, or even restart the application with a changed configuration file.
    * Grant access to certain features based on user attributes, like payment plan (eg: users on the ‘gold’ plan get access to more features than users in the ‘silver’ plan). Disable parts of your application to facilitate maintenance, without taking everything offline.
